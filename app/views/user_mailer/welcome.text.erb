PC Medlink is managed by your Health Unit and orders will be processed on the 1st of the month. You will receive a confirmation e-mail when you submit an order. You will also receive an e-mail when your order has been processed. This e-mail will contain instructions from your PCMO and inform you of whether your request has been made ready for pick-up, delivery, or refused. Order processing is at the discretion of your Health Unit.

Instructions for SMS
--------------------

Send an SMS to +1 (202) 999-3852 with the supply short codes of the items you would like and any special instructions. You should format your message like this:

    Supply Short Code 1, Supply Short Code 2, Supply Short Code 3 - Special Instructions

Note that you can order a single item or multiple items in the same SMS message by simply adding additional short codes separated by commas. You can also add special instructions to your order by including a dash "-" after your last supply short code and before your message.

If your request is received without errors, you will receive a confirmation that the system received the request. Once your order is processed by the health unit you will receive a response via text and e-mail with the details of how you will receive approved items.
